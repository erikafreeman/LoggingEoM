Quality Control

All water samples filtered through 0.45 μm glass fiber filters
Samples for DOM analysis stored at 4°C in dark conditions
Analytical blanks and standards run every 10 samples
Duplicate samples analyzed for 10% of measurements
Detection limits available upon request

Collection Methods

Water Sampling:

500mL grab samples collected monthly
Samples taken from channel heads of streams
Filtered on-site or within 24 hours
Preserved according to analytical requirements


Chemical Analysis:

DOM quantified using Shimadzu TOC-L analyzer
Optical properties measured via fluorescence spectroscopy
Major ions and metals analyzed at Great Lakes Forestry Centre



Usage Notes

Time series analysis should account for:

Seasonal variations in stream chemistry
Ice-free season sampling only
Treatment effect beginning September 2020


Data includes pre-treatment (2019-Sept 2020) and post-treatment (Sept 2020-2021) periods
Some variables may show high temporal variability due to:

Storm events
Seasonal changes
Treatment effects



Data Processing

Raw data cleaned and formatted in R
Quality control flags removed for final dataset
Time standardization applied
Missing values coded as NA

Access and Permissions
[To be completed based on project requirements]
Known Issues or Limitations

Sampling limited to ice-free seasons
Some parameters show seasonal gaps
Storm event sampling may be underrepresented
