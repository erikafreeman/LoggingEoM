Logging Impacts on Stream Molecular Biogeochemsitry

Project Overview

This repository contains data and analysis for research investigating how logging activities affect dissolved organic matter (DOM) in headwater streams. The study was conducted in northern Ontario, Canada, using a before-after control-impact (BACI) experimental design across four catchments over three years.
Key Findings

DOM concentration in logged catchments increased up to 4x in the first two months post-harvest
Changes in molecular composition persisted for at least two years
Logging increased chemical diversity and introduced novel compounds
Stream DOM composition showed increased similarity to soil DOM post-harvest
Estimated 6.4% of harvested carbon was lost through increased DOM export

Methods Summary
